# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This nanodegree programs includes projects in Data Analysis, Practical Statistics, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualization. 

For each project, I was able to gain new skills in working with messy, complex datasets, manipulating, preparing data for analysis, and creating visualizations 
for data exploration. Finally, I learn to use the data skills to tell a story with data.

### Tools I Use
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

### Concepts I Learn

- Data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data.
- Applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models
- Data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data.
- Applying visualization principles to the data analysis process in order to find insights and create a compelling story.
